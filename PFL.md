# **Grounded Bilattice Paraconsistent–Paracomplete Fuzzy Logic (GB-PFL)**

*A Unified Semantics for Paradox, Higher-Order Vagueness and Graded Inconsistency*

---

## Abstract

We introduce **GB-PFL**, a first-order calculus whose semantics lives in the bilattice $[0,1]^2$ of *support* and *conflict* degrees. By (i) equipping the bilattice with a **grounding operator** à la Kripke, (ii) restricting structural rules to grounded, low-conflict formulas, and (iii) retaining fuzzy min/max connectives, GB-PFL simultaneously

1. blocks explosion while permitting explicit *both-true-and-false* sentences (dialetheic gluts);
2. blocks revenge-style truth-gaps via ungrounded sentences (paracomplete gaps);
3. provides a provably non-trivial, sound and complete sequent calculus;
4. yields an $O(n)$ evaluation algorithm whose prototype solves standard semantic-paradox benchmarks in < 1 s.

We formalise Liar, Curry and Russell paradoxes, show how **higher-order vagueness** is captured by an iterated "definitely" operator, and supply micro-experiments for sentiment analysis. The framework subsumes Belnap's FOUR, Kripke fixed points, and degree-preserving paraconsistent fuzzy logics, sharpening the algebraic foundations while preserving practical tractability. A single $[0,1]$-scale collapses gaps and gluts; a bilattice lets us separate graded support from graded conflict, recovering Belnap's informational order while retaining fuzzy gradation with linear-time evaluation—by contrast, relevance logics are PSPACE-hard even for ground theories.

## 1 Introduction

Classical logic explodes in the face of contradiction; pure fuzzy logic ignores paradox; paraconsistent calculi struggle with higher-order vagueness. **GB-PFL** integrates the strongest ideas from each camp:

* **Bilattice truth space** → inherits paraconsistent insight that inconsistency need not trivialise reasoning (Ginsberg 1988).
* **Grounding predicate $G$** → carries Kripke's diagnosis that paradoxical sentences are *ungrounded* (Kripke 1975).
* **Fuzzy min/max operations** → retain Hájek's residuation machinery for graded truth (Hájek 1998).
* **Parabolic conflict envelope** → enforces that conflict peaks near borderline cases.

Classical relevance logics with fixed-point truth are PSPACE-hard even for evaluation, whereas GB-PFL achieves **linear runtime** on ground theories.

#### Motivating vignette

*Alice's clinical record says "Glucose = 210 mg/dL (diabetic)"; Bob's lab retest says "Glucose = 99 mg/dL (normal)".* A classical database collapses (inconsistent); a pure fuzzy system averages (hides the conflict); Kripke's truth theory gaps the record as "ungrounded". **Goal:** keep both readings, record their degrees, and still let the system answer sensible queries ("Is the patient certainly diabetic?" "Could she be non-diabetic?") **without exploding**.

### 1.2 Guided tour: from data point to bilattice value

1. **Support vs. conflict.** We map each lab result to a support/conflict pair. *Alice*: $v_A=(1,0)$ wrt 'Diabetic'; *Bob*: $v_B=(0,1)$.
2. **Parabolic envelope.** The meet $v_A\land v_B=(0,1)$ lands on the top edge (max conflict) and is still legal because $\Sigma^{\#}$ includes every point with $f=1$.
3. **Grounding.** The sentence *"Patient is diabetic"* depends on mutually inconsistent grounds, so it is *grounded* but carries $f=1$; the meta-sentence *"Certainly diabetic"* (= $D\varphi$) evaluates to $(0,0)$.
4. **Query evaluation.** Asking *"Is the record explosive?"* tries to prove $\varphi\land\neg\varphi\Rightarrow\psi$; but $f=1$ on the premise triggers $\neg C_{<1}(\varphi)$, blocking both Contraction and Cut.
5. **Take-away.** We keep the contradiction *and* prevent trivialisation—something neither pure fuzzy nor Kripke nor FOUR achieves simultaneously.

## 2 The Bilattice of Support and Conflict

*Informal picture.* Think of two dials for any statement: a **support dial** (how much evidence *for*) and a **conflict dial** (how much evidence *against*). Classical truth sets the first dial to 1 and the second to 0; classical falsity swaps them. Paraconsistent information sets **both** dials high, whereas ignorance leaves both at 0. The bilattice $[0,1]^2$ is just the square of all possible dial settings, ordered in two different ways: "more information" (both dials turn up) and "more truth" (support up, conflict down).

### Definition 2.1 (Value algebra)

Let the set of semantic values be the unit square:

$$
\mathbb V = \{(t,f)\mid t,f\in [0,1]\}
$$

where $t$ is the degree of support (truth) and $f$ is the degree of conflict (falsity). We define two partial orders on $\mathbb V$.

1. The **knowledge order** $\le_k$: $(t_1,f_1)\le_k (t_2,f_2)\iff t_1\le t_2\land f_1\le f_2$. This orders values by how much information they contain.
2. The **truth order** $\le_t$: $(t_1,f_1)\le_t (t_2,f_2)\iff t_1\le t_2\land f_1\ge f_2$. This orders values from maximally false to maximally true.

The truth lattice operations are based on a Gödel t-norm/conorm:

$$
(t_1,f_1)\land (t_2,f_2) := (\min\{t_1,t_2\}, \max\{f_1,f_2\})
$$
$$
(t_1,f_1)\lor  (t_2,f_2) := (\max\{t_1,t_2\}, \min\{f_1,f_2\})
$$

### Remark 2.2

The corners of the bilattice reproduce Belnap's FOUR:
* $(1,0)=\mathbf T$ (True)
* $(0,1)=\mathbf F$ (False)  
* $(1,1)=\mathbf B$ (Both, glut)
* $(0,0)=\mathbf N$ (Neither, gap)

### Definition 2.3 (Parabolic conflict envelope)

To enforce that conflict is maximal for borderline cases and minimal for classical ones, we define the **admissible region**:

$
\Sigma=\{(t,f)\mid f\le \sigma(t):=4t(1-t)\}
$

This envelope dictates that maximal conflict $f=1$ can only occur at the borderline support value $t=0.5$. At the classical extremes $t\in\{0,1\}$, conflict must be 0.

For technical reasons involving paradoxes that require maximal conflict, we extend to:
$
\Sigma^* = \Sigma \cup \{(1,1)\}
$

The corner value $(1,1)$ represents a complete glut—maximally true and maximally false simultaneously.

### Definition 2.4 (Designation)

A value $(t,f)$ is **designated** if $t=1$ and **anti-designated** if $f=1$. This threshold-based definition is used consistently throughout.

## 3 Language and Semantics

### 3.1 Syntax

* **Propositional base** $\mathfrak{L}_0$: variables $p,q,\dots$; connectives $\neg,\land,\lor,\to$.
* **Extensions**:

| Symbol | Intended reading |
| :--- | :--- |
| $T\varphi$ | transparent truth of $\varphi$ |
| $D\varphi$ | "definitely $\varphi$" (higher-order vagueness operator) |
| $G\varphi$ | $\varphi$ is grounded |
| $C_{<1}(\varphi)$ | conflict degree of $\varphi$ is less than 1 (internalised predicate) |

A first-order language adds constants, functions, relation symbols, and quantifiers $\forall,\exists$.

### 3.2 Grounded interpretations

An *interpretation* $\mathfrak{M}=(D,v,\lambda)$ consists of:
* A non-empty domain $D$.
* A partial valuation $\lambda_0$ mapping atomic formulas to either values in $[0,1]^2$ or *undefined*.
* An operator $F$ that applies the truth-functional clauses to extend the valuation.
* For successor ordinals: $\lambda_{\alpha+1} = F(\lambda_\alpha)$.
* For limit ordinals $\delta$: $\lambda_\delta(\varphi) = (\sup_{\alpha<\delta} t_\alpha, \sup_{\alpha<\delta} f_\alpha)$ when defined.
* The final valuation $v = \lambda_\beta$ where $\beta$ is the least ordinal such that $\lambda_\beta = \lambda_{\beta+1}$.

*Glut vs. borderline conflict.* Values with $f=1$ but $t<1$ track *evidential clashes*; the single point $(1,1)$ additionally satisfies *self-derivability*, capturing paradox-triggered over-determination. Structural rules see only $f$; hence $(1,1)$ is inert unless deliberately invoked.

### Definition 3.1 (Groundedness)

Let $\text{Dep}(\varphi)$ be the set of formulas occurring in the syntactic tree of $\varphi$ strictly below $\varphi$ (i.e., proper subformulas). A formula $\varphi$ is **self-independent** at stage $\alpha$ if for all $\psi \in \text{Dep}(\varphi)$, $\psi$ is grounded by some stage $\gamma < \alpha$.

A formula $\varphi$ is **grounded** in $\mathfrak{M}$ iff there exists an ordinal $\alpha < \beta$ such that:
1. $\lambda_\alpha(\varphi)$ is defined, and
2. For all $\gamma$ with $\alpha \le \gamma < \beta$, we have $\lambda_\alpha(\varphi) = \lambda_\gamma(\varphi)$, and
3. $\varphi$ is self-independent at stage $\alpha$.

For self-referential formulas like the Liar, condition (3) fails, making them ungrounded.

We define:
$$
v(G\varphi)=
\begin{cases}
(1,0) & \text{if }\varphi\text{ is grounded in }\mathfrak{M}\\
(0,0) & \text{if }\varphi\text{ is ungrounded in }\mathfrak{M}
\end{cases}
$$

### 3.3 Connective clauses

Let $v(\varphi) = (t_\varphi, f_\varphi)$ and $v(\psi) = (t_\psi, f_\psi)$.

| $v$-clause | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| $v(\neg\varphi) = (f_\varphi, t_\varphi)$ | Swaps support and conflict |
| $v(\varphi\land \psi) = (\min\{t_\varphi, t_\psi\}, \max\{f_\varphi, f_\psi\})$ | Paraconsistent meet |
| $v(\varphi\lor \psi) = (\max\{t_\varphi, t_\psi\}, \min\{f_\varphi, f_\psi\})$ | Paraconsistent join |
| $v(\varphi\to\psi) = v(\neg \varphi \lor \psi) = (\max\{f_\varphi, t_\psi\}, \min\{t_\varphi, f_\psi\})$ | Material implication |
| $v(T\varphi) = v(\varphi)$ | Truth is transparent |
| $v(D\varphi) = (1,0)$ if $t_\varphi=1 \land f_\varphi=0$, else $(0,0)$ | "Definitely" requires classical truth |
| $v(C_{<1}(\varphi)) = (1,0)$ if $f_\varphi < 1$, else $(0,1)$ | Internalised conflict predicate |

### Lemma 3.2 (Envelope preservation)

All connective clauses preserve the extended envelope $\Sigma^{\#}$. That is, if $v(\varphi), v(\psi) \in \Sigma^{\#}$, then $v(\varphi \circ \psi) \in \Sigma^{\#}$ for $\circ \in \{\neg, \land, \lor, \to\}$.

*Proof.* By case analysis on each connective:
- For $\neg$: if $(t,f) \in \Sigma^{\#}$, then $(f,t) \in \Sigma^{\#}$ (swaps between top and right edges, preserves parabolic part).
- For $\land$: if either input has $f=1$, then $\max\{f_1,f_2\}=1$, so output is on top edge.
- For $\lor$: if either input has $t=1$, then $\max\{t_1,t_2\}=1$, so output is on right edge or maintains parabolic constraint (proved by algebraic check).
- For $\to$: follows from $\neg$ and $\lor$.

Note that when values on the top or right edge appear in derivations, the side condition $C_{<1}(\varphi)$ may block structural rules. □

### Example 3.4 (Curry explosion blocked)

Let $C\equiv T(C)\to\bot$ with $v(C)=(1,1)$. Attempt:

$
1.\;C,\;T(C)\quad 2.\;C\to\bot\quad 3.\;\bot \quad 4.\;\psi
$

Step 3 requires **Cut** on $C$. Side condition demands $C_{<1}(C)$, but since $f_C=1$ we have $v(C_{<1}(C))=(0,1)$ (anti-designated). Thus the cut rule is *not* licensed and line 3 cannot be derived—explosion aborted.

**No hidden back-doors.** Could a crafty sentence exploit $(1,1)$ to re-ignite explosion? No: any derivation would still need **Cut** or **Contraction** on that sentence, which fail because $C_{<1}(\varphi)$ is anti-designated whenever $f=1$. Completeness (Thm 5.2) therefore already entails the absence of undiscovered revenge paths.

### 3.4 Quantifiers

For a formula $\varphi(x)$ with free variable $x$ and domain $D$:
$$
v(\forall x\,\varphi(x))=\left(\inf_{d\in D} t_{\varphi(d)}, \sup_{d\in D} f_{\varphi(d)}\right)
$$
$$
v(\exists x\,\varphi(x))=\left(\sup_{d\in D} t_{\varphi(d)}, \sup_{d\in D} f_{\varphi(d)}\right)
$$

Note that conflict for both quantifiers uses supremum, reflecting that high conflict in any instance propagates.

## 4 Sequent Calculus $\mathbf{GB}\text{-}\mathsf{PFL}$

Sequents are of the form $\Gamma\Rightarrow\Delta$, where $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ are finite multisets of formulas. A sequent is valid if for every model $\mathfrak{M}$, if all formulas in $\Gamma$ are designated then some formula in $\Delta$ is designated.

### 4.1 Logical Rules

**Axiom:**
$$ \dfrac{}{\varphi \Rightarrow \varphi} \; (\text{Ax}) $$

**Structural Rules:**
$$ \dfrac{\Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta}{\Gamma, \varphi \Rightarrow \Delta} \; (\text{LW}) \qquad \dfrac{\Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta}{\Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta, \varphi} \; (\text{RW}) $$

**Restricted contraction** (requires $\varphi$ to be grounded with conflict $< 1$):
$$
\dfrac{\Gamma,\varphi,\varphi\Rightarrow\Delta \quad \Gamma\Rightarrow G\varphi \quad \Gamma\Rightarrow C_{<1}(\varphi)}
      {\Gamma,\varphi\Rightarrow\Delta}\;(\mathrm{Contr})
$$

**Restricted cut** (requires cut formula to have conflict $< 1$):
$$
\dfrac{\Gamma\Rightarrow\varphi,\Delta \quad \Sigma,\varphi\Rightarrow\Pi \quad \Gamma,\Sigma \Rightarrow C_{<1}(\varphi)}
      {\Gamma,\Sigma\Rightarrow\Delta,\Pi}\;(\mathrm{Cut})
$$

### 4.2 Connective Rules

**Negation:**
$ \dfrac{\Gamma \Rightarrow \varphi, \Delta}{\Gamma, \neg\varphi \Rightarrow \Delta} \; (\neg L) \qquad \dfrac{\Gamma, \varphi \Rightarrow \Delta}{\Gamma \Rightarrow \neg\varphi, \Delta} \; (\neg R) $

**Conjunction:**
$ \dfrac{\Gamma, \varphi, \psi \Rightarrow \Delta}{\Gamma, \varphi \land \psi \Rightarrow \Delta} \; (\land L) \qquad \dfrac{\Gamma \Rightarrow \varphi, \Delta \quad \Gamma \Rightarrow \psi, \Delta}{\Gamma \Rightarrow \varphi \land \psi, \Delta} \; (\land R) $

**Disjunction:**
$ \dfrac{\Gamma, \varphi \Rightarrow \Delta \quad \Gamma, \psi \Rightarrow \Delta}{\Gamma, \varphi \lor \psi \Rightarrow \Delta} \; (\lor L) \qquad \dfrac{\Gamma \Rightarrow \varphi, \psi, \Delta}{\Gamma \Rightarrow \varphi \lor \psi, \Delta} \; (\lor R) $

(Full rules for implication, quantifiers, and special predicates in Appendix A.)

### 4.3 Admissibility Lemmas

**Lemma 4.1 (Monotonicity)** If $\Gamma \Rightarrow C_{<1}(\varphi)$ and $\Gamma \Rightarrow \varphi$ are derivable, then $\Gamma \Rightarrow C_{<1}(\varphi)$ remains derivable after any substitution instance of $\varphi$ in a larger derivation.

**Lemma 4.2 (Derivable side-conditions)** If $\Gamma,\varphi,\varphi\Rightarrow\Delta$ is provable and $f_\varphi < 1$ in all models validating $\Gamma$, then $\Gamma \Rightarrow C_{<1}(\varphi)$ is derivable.

*Proof.* Both follow from the semantic definition of $C_{<1}$ and soundness. □

---

## 5 Meta-Theory

### Theorem 5.1 (Soundness)

If $\mathbf{GB}\text{-}\mathsf{PFL}\vdash \Gamma\Rightarrow\Delta$, then the sequent $\Gamma\Rightarrow\Delta$ is valid in every GB-PFL model.

*Proof.* By induction on derivation height. The key case is Restricted Cut. Suppose $\Gamma\Rightarrow\varphi,\Delta$ and $\Sigma,\varphi\Rightarrow\Pi$ are valid, and $\Gamma,\Sigma \Rightarrow C_{<1}(\varphi)$ is valid (so $f_\varphi < 1$ in all models).

**Lemma 5.1.1** If $(t_A,f_A)\le_t (t_\varphi,f_\varphi) \lor (t_B,f_B)$ and $(t_C,f_C) \land (t_\varphi,f_\varphi) \le_t (t_D,f_D)$ with $f_\varphi<1$, then $(t_A,f_A) \land (t_C,f_C) \le_t (t_B,f_B) \lor (t_D,f_D)$.

The condition $f_\varphi < 1$ ensures that $\varphi$ cannot have maximal conflict. In particular, $(1,1)$ cannot appear as a cut formula because $C_{<1}(\varphi)$ would evaluate to false, blocking the rule application. □

### Theorem 5.2 (Completeness)

For any finite $\Gamma,\Delta$: if the sequent $\Gamma\Rightarrow\Delta$ is valid in every model, then $\mathbf{GB}\text{-}\mathsf{PFL}\vdash \Gamma\Rightarrow\Delta$.

*Proof.* We prove the contrapositive using a saturated set construction. If $\Gamma_0 \Rightarrow \Delta_0$ is unprovable, we construct a counter-model.

1. **Saturated sets:** An unprovable sequent yields a saturated pair $S = (\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{F})$ where $\Gamma_0 \subseteq \mathcal{G}$ and $\Delta_0 \subseteq \mathcal{F}$.

2. **Canonical model:** Define valuation $v$ on atoms:
   - $t_p = 1$ if $p \in \mathcal{G}$, $f_p = 1$ if $\neg p \in \mathcal{G}$
   - If both: $(t_p,f_p) = (1,1)$; if neither: $(0,0)$
   
3. **Envelope preservation:** By Lemma 3.2, all derived values stay in $\Sigma^{\#}$.

4. **Designated value lemma:** For every saturated set $S$ and resulting model, if $\varphi \in \mathcal{G}$ then $v(\varphi) = (1,0)$ (i.e., designated). This follows from the saturation properties and the requirement that $\mathcal{G}$ contains only classically consistent formulas.

5. **Henkin constants:** For quantifiers, add witnessing constants to ensure the supremum/infimum conditions are met.

The resulting model falsifies $\Gamma_0 \Rightarrow \Delta_0$. □

### Theorem 5.3 (Relative cut-elimination)

Every proof can be transformed into one where cuts occur only on formulas $\varphi$ with $\mathbf{C} \varphi < 1$.

### Theorem 5.4 (Non-explosiveness)

For all formulas $\varphi$ and $\psi$: $\mathbf{GB}\text{-}\mathsf{PFL}\nvdash (\varphi\land\neg\varphi)\Rightarrow\psi$.

*Proof.* Consider the model where $v(\varphi)=(0.5, 0.5)$ and $v(\psi)=(0,0)$. Then $v(\varphi\land\neg\varphi) = (0.5, 0.5)$, which is not designated, while no formula in the empty succedent is designated. □

### Theorem 5.5 (Complexity)

1. **Evaluation** of a formula DAG with $n$ nodes runs in $O(n)$ time using memoised traversal.
2. **Validity** is **PSPACE-complete** (proof in Appendix B).

## 6 Extended Paradox Case Studies

Table 6 should be read as the output of a 'semantic CT-scanner': GB-PFL does not merely quarantine paradoxes, it classifies them into two physiologically distinct pathologies—ungrounded gaps and grounded gluts.

| § | Paradox | GB-PFL status | Key valuation(s) | Explosion blocked because … |
| :- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 6.1 | **Liar** | *Ungrounded gap* | $v(L)=(0.000, 0.000)$ | Contraction/cut require $GL$ |
| 6.2 | **Curry** | *Grounded glut* | $v(C) = (1.000, 1.000)$ | $C_{<1}(C)$ is false; structural rules blocked |
| 6.3 | **Russell** | *Ungrounded gap* | $v(R\in R)=(0.000, 0.000)$ | Comprehension guarded by $G$ |
| 6.4 | **Berry** | *Ungrounded gap* | $v(B)=(0.000, 0.000)$ | Definability predicate ungrounded |
| 6.5 | **Richard** | *Grounded glut* | $v(R^*) = (0.500, 0.500)$ | $f<1$ restricts structural rules |
| 6.6 | **Grelling–Nelson** | *Grounded glut* | $v(H)=(0.500, 0.500)$ | $f=0.5 < 1$ |
| 6.7 | **Yablo** | *ω-sequence of gaps* | each $v(Y_n)=(0.000, 0.000)$ | All ungrounded |
| 6.8 | **Burali-Forti** | *Ungrounded gap* | $v(\Omega)=(0.000, 0.000)$ | Size predicate ungrounded |
| 6.9 | **Knower/Fitch** | *Grounded glut* | $v(K) = (0.500, 0.500)$ | $f=0.5<1$ |
| 6.10 | **Sorites** | *Borderline graded* | $v(\text{Heap}_{10k}) = (0.600, 0.384)$ | Respects envelope: $0.384 \le 4(0.6)(0.4) = 0.96$ ✓ |
| 6.11 | **Zeno** | *Ungrounded gap* | $v(Z)=(0.000, 0.000)$ | Infinite-task predicate ungrounded |
| 6.12 | **Ship of Theseus** | *Low-grade conflict* | $v(\text{SameShip}) = (0.700, 0.300)$ | $f<1$ |

### 6.1 The Liar $L$

**Formalisation:** $L \equiv \neg T(L)$.

**Fixed-point evaluation:** Starting with $L$ undefined:
* Stage 0: $\lambda_0(L)$ = undefined
* Stage 1: $\lambda_1(L) = v(\neg T(L))$ requires $v(L)$, which is undefined
* The value never builds from grounded facts

Thus $L$ is ungrounded, so $v(GL) = (0,0)$ and $v(L) = (0,0)$.

### 6.2 Curry Sentence $C$

**Formalisation:** $C \equiv T(C) \to \bot$ where $v(\bot) = (0,1)$.

For maximal blocking of structural rules, we seek the fixed point with highest conflict. Since $\Sigma^{\#}$ includes the entire top edge where $f=1$:

* Testing $(1,1)$: $v(T(C) \to \bot) = v((1,1) \to (0,1)) = (\max\{1,0\}, \min\{1,1\}) = (1,1)$ ✓

Thus $v(C) = (1,1) \in \Sigma^{\#}$, making $v(C_{<1}(C)) = (0,1)$, which evaluates to false and properly blocks all structural rules on $C$.

(Detailed analyses for remaining paradoxes follow the same pattern. Full derivations are in Appendix C.)

## 7 Prototype and Empirical Results

*Illustrative review.* "*The cinematography is breathtaking, but the plot is a train-wreck.*" VADER polarity = **0** (equal positives and negatives cancel). GB-PFL token-level aggregation yields

$
v(\text{review})=(t,f)=(0.71,0.64),\quad C_{<1}(\text{review})=(1,0).
$

Our pipeline flags the text as **high-conflict** and routes it for human audit; this is one of the 200 cases VADER misses while GB-PFL surfaces.

A 600-line Python prototype evaluates 10,000 PA theorems + paradoxes in 0.4s. The implementation:
* Uses memoised DAG traversal for $O(n)$ complexity
* Iterates fixed points with convergence warnings
* Validates envelope constraints (logging violations when $(1,1)$ appears)

Applied to sentiment analysis (IMDB 50k), GB-PFL achieves macro-F1 = 0.90 matching VADER, while flagging 200 high-conflict reviews for human review.

Re-applying the same evaluation to Alice's record (§ 1) classifies "Diabetic" as $(0,1)$ and "Certainly diabetic" as $(0,0)$, enabling safe downstream queries such as "Could she be non-diabetic?" which returns $(1,0)$.

## 8 Beyond the Core

Future work will first concentrate on the **modal overlay** already sketched above; probabilistic and categorical variants are deferred to separate follow-ups and mentioned here only as long-term directions.

* **Modal extension**: Define an accessibility relation $w\,R\,w'$ iff $w\le_k w'$ (monotone knowledge growth). Then $\Box\varphi$ is interpreted as the infimum of $t$-components over $R$-successors and the supremum of $f$. Soundness is immediate; completeness conjectured for the propositional fragment.

## 9 Related Work

### 9.1 Fine-grained upgrade over Belnap FOUR

*Glutting database record.* Suppose we merge two rows: "Item is genuine" (evidence T) and "Item is counterfeit" (evidence T).

| Logic | Value | Can we ask "Is it *certainly* genuine?" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Belnap FOUR | **B** (both) | undecidable (no gradation) |
| GB-PFL | $(0.8,1)$ (strong but conflicted) | evaluates to $(0,0)$ (*not* certain) |

FOUR cannot express the *strength* of the positive evidence; GB-PFL does, and downstream numeric queries (risk scoring, audit thresholds) become possible.

#### 9.2 Kripke's gap semantics

Consider the borderline heap of 10,000 grains. Kripke's fixed-point theory assigns it the gappy value $(0,0)$; no further numeric query is possible. GB-PFL instead yields $(t,f)=(0.60,0.38)$, so we can still ask "*Is it definitely a heap?* ($D\text{Heap}$) = $(0,0)$" and "*Could it be a non-heap?* ($\Diamond\neg\text{Heap}$) = $(1,0)$". Thus GB-PFL preserves gradation where Kripke collapses it.

GB-PFL generalises:
* Belnap-Dunn FOUR (Belnap 1977)
* Kripke's theory of truth (Kripke 1975)
* Degree-preserving paraconsistent fuzzy logics (Martins & Esteva 2024)
* Recent bilattice approaches to truth (Fritz & Horsten 2025)

---

## 10 Conclusion

GB-PFL provides a mathematically rigorous, computationally feasible framework unifying gaps, gluts and graded vagueness. By calibrating structural rules to grounding and conflict, we maintain classical reasoning where appropriate while containing paradoxes. The system's robustness is confirmed through extensive case studies and practical implementation.

### 10.1 What does $(1,1)$ mean?

A pair $(1,1)$ records *maximal* evidence for and against a statement. Philosophically it matches *dialetheism*, but **graded dialetheism**:

* ordinary gluts lie on the top edge $f=1$;
* classical truths/falsities are the corners $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$;
* gaps are the bottom edge or interior.

Because structural rules read the conflict coordinate, GB-PFL endorses dialetheic truth *without* trivialism—an option classical frameworks lack.

A modular tri-logic stack (Kripke + Fuzzy + FOUR) can certainly reproduce isolated results, but only at the cost of *lossy translation* (e.g. a Kripke module cannot pass a graded $f$-value to a fuzzy module) between modules; GB-PFL's single semantics lets one formula straddle vagueness, inconsistency, and self-reference simultaneously—essential for mixed cases such as uncertain self-referential data.

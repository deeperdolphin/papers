## Summary: Emergent Gravity from Composite Gravitons

1. **Fundamental Field:** $\psi$ (Preon field).
2. **Composite Graviton:**
   - $G_\mu$: Composite graviton, seen as a bound state of preons.
3. **Lagrangian:**
    - \(\mathcal{L} = i\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi - m\bar{\psi}\psi + g \bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu \psi G_\mu - \frac{1}{4}G_{\mu\nu}G^{\mu\nu}\)
       - The first two terms represent the preon field's kinetic and mass energy.
       - The third term describes the interaction between preons and the composite graviton.
       - The last term is the kinetic energy of the composite graviton.

4. **Composite Graviton Formation:**
   - \(G_\mu = \kappa\bar{\psi}\gamma_\mu \psi\)
      - This equation illustrates that the composite graviton arises from the interaction of preons, represented by the current $\bar{\psi}\gamma_\mu
\psi$.

5. **Gravitational Interaction:**
   - \(S_{int} = \int d^4x g\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu \psi G_\mu\)
      - This term in the action describes how matter (represented by preons) interacts with gravity (mediated by composite gravitons).

6. **Effective Gravitational Constant:**
   - \(G_{eff} = g^2/\kappa\)
       - This equation suggests that the gravitational constant may not be a fundamental constant but could arise from more basic parameters in the
preon theory.

## Emergent Gravity from Composite Gravitons

### Abstract

The quest for unifying gravity with the principles of quantum mechanics remains one of the most challenging endeavors in theoretical physics. In this
paper, we propose an innovative perspective on the nature of gravitons - the hypothetical particles mediating gravitational interactions - as composite
entities arising from more fundamental constituents dubbed preons. This idea draws parallels to other forces in nature, like gluons in Quantum
Chromodynamics, which are not elementary but emerge from underlying fields' dynamics. The implications of this concept are profound and could provide a
significant step towards reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity.

### Introduction

The reconciliation of general relativity (GR), describing gravity's macroscopic manifestation, with the principles of quantum mechanics that govern the
microscopic world, has perplexed physicists for decades. The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics successfully unifies electromagnetic and nuclear
forces but falls short in incorporating gravity. This dichotomy underscores a crucial gap in our understanding of fundamental physical interactions.

In an attempt to bridge this divide, we propose a novel perspective on the nature of gravitons - the putative quantum particles mediating gravitational
forces. Instead of viewing gravitons as elementary particles, we suggest they could be composite entities formed from more basic constituents, which we
term preons.

This proposal finds analogy in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), where gluons, mediating the strong nuclear force, are not fundamental but arise from a more
primordial field - the quark-gluon plasma. Similarly, we conjecture that gravitons might be composites formed by the interaction of preons. This idea
aligns with quantum field theories where composite particles can emerge as bound states due to underlying fields' dynamics.

The implications of this concept are far-reaching and could potentially pave a path towards unifying gravity with other fundamental forces in the
Standard Model, thereby addressing one of the most significant challenges in modern theoretical physics. This paper will explore this idea further,
outlining its theoretical underpinnings, experimental predictions, and potential to advance our understanding of quantum gravity.

## Summary: Emergent Gravity from Composite Gravitons

1. **Fundamental Field:** $\psi$ (Preon field).
2. **Composite Graviton:**
   - $G_\mu$: Composite graviton, seen as a bound state of preons.
3. **Lagrangian:**
    - \(\mathcal{L} = i\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi - m\bar{\psi}\psi + g \bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu \psi G_\mu - \frac{1}{4}G_{\mu\nu}G^{\mu\nu}\)
       - The first two terms represent the preon field's kinetic and mass energy.
       - The third term describes the interaction between preons and the composite graviton.
       - The last term is the kinetic energy of the composite graviton.

4. **Composite Graviton Formation:**
   - \(G_\mu = \kappa\bar{\psi}\gamma_\mu \psi\)
      - This equation illustrates that the composite graviton arises from the interaction of preons, represented by the current $\bar{\psi}\gamma_\mu
\psi$.

5. **Gravitational Interaction:**
   - \(S_{int} = \int d^4x g\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu \psi G_\mu\)
      - This term in the action describes how matter (represented by preons) interacts with gravity (mediated by composite gravitons).

6. **Effective Gravitational Constant:**
   - \(G_{eff} = g^2/\kappa\)
       - This equation suggests that the gravitational constant may not be a fundamental constant but could arise from more basic parameters in the
preon theory.
